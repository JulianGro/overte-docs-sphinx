Overte is a virtual worlds software where you can connect and create with others. We invite you to explore the worlds created in Overte and interact with other users. You can visit friends' virtual worlds, meet people, attend events, and learn about creation in virtuality. It's an immersive and interactive experience with realistic visuals and audio.

If it's your first time using Overte, you'll start your journey in a local tutorial space by yourself, where you can experiment with the controls and learn about the Interface. When you are ready, try exploring other domains using the Explore app and socialize with people around the metaverse. If you've visited Overte before, you will return to the location where you last visited.

Throughout this chapter, learn how to make the most of your exploration:

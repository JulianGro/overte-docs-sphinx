Overte enables people connected by interest, community, and friendship to come together and express their creativity with each other. We invite you to personalize your own experience by creating avatars and content, or developing apps and scripts. To truly make the experience your own, creating your own world or building your immersive project using the free and openly licensed Overte engine is encouraged!

No matter your level of expertise, Overte provides the tools you need to create anything you can imagine.

Throughout this chapter, learn how to create, build, and bring to life your own VR experience:

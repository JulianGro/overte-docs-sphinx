We are thrilled you've decided to host a custom domain with us on the metaverse! We also understand that setting up a server, configuring it, and creating a domain takes some time and technical knowledge. Hopefully, this section will help you become familiar with the basics of hosting domains in Overte, so that you can create the space you want and be a part of building a bigger, more expansive metaverse.

You can also follow the :doc:`quick start guide <quick-start>` to boot up a Domain right away.

----------------------------
Overview of Hosting
----------------------------

Overte's hosting interface consists of the following components that work together to create an immersive VR experience for your visitors:

* The *Domain server* is a virtual world that gives you a space to build content in.
* A *domain* is a server in the metaverse. Each domain is assigned a unique ID to identify it. You can connect your domain to the Overte Metaverse Server by logging into your account on the Overte website.
* A *place* is a registered location in the metaverse. A place is connected to a domain; you can create multiple places per domain.
* A *server* hosts a domain, and processes incoming network requests for the domain. The server for your domain is either a physical computer or a cloud-hosted server such as one provided by DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS, and so on.
* A *content set* is the content that you've added to your world.

3. :doc:`Add content to your domain <add-content>`
4. :doc:`Set up user permissions <configure-settings/permission-settings>`

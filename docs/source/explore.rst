Overte is a self-hostable, open-source, decentralized social virtual reality software that allows you to connect and create with others.
You can travel through virtual spaces created by your friends, interact with various people, attend events, and create and host your own worlds.

If it's your first time using Overte, you'll start your journey in a local tutorial space by yourself, where you can experiment with the controls and learn about the Interface.
When you are ready, try exploring other domains using the Places app and socialize with people around the metaverse.
If you've visited Overte before, you will return to the location where you last visited.

Throughout this chapter, learn how to make the most of your exploration:
